Hi! I'm Jimmy, a security practicioner currently working as a SOC Analyst.  
I find malware and cybersecurity extremely fascinating, and am grateful to be able to work in this industry. 
These webpages will host some of my thoughts and findings as I continue to grow and develop my threat hunting and analysis skills.
